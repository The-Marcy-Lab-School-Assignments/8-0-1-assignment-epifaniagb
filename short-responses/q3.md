# Question

What are "static assets"? How do you generate static assets in a React project?

# Answer

Static assets are files that are served to the client as-is without being processed by the server, aka they do not change dynamically. An example could be an image. In React, you place your static assets in the public directory and can be referenced in React components using their relative paths.
